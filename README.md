# NXTZ SPORTS: Professional Football Database

## Description
This project is designed to provide professional football (soccer) player data.  A user searches by league, and then by the name of a professional football player. The app returns information, statistics and standings on that player from the previous season.

## Reason for setting up the project
The purpose of this app is to eliminate the user from having to click through multiple pages and links to get information. In our research on football players, we found there is no easy way to just pull up a player's stats without going through mulitple steps. We also found additional  information and statistics about the player that were not readily available. 

## Useage
To use this app, one must click on a league name from the drop-down box.  Then the user must type in the name of a specific player's name and 
click enter. Along with a photo and a brief description of the player, the following information will be returned: Average Rating, Goals, xG, Assists, Pass Percentage, Successful Dribbles, Tackles, Interceptions and Clearances.

## Direction of Future Development
To develop this app we used a database of only a small portion of professional football leagues. In order for this app to stand out and be
superior, at some point, we would like to be able to add the names of all the professional soccer leagues and their players. This will then provide the user with a complete, concise resource to get any, and all information, statistics and standings in one location.
