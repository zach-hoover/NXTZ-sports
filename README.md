# NXTZ SPORTS: PSPS - Professional Soccer Player Stats

## Description
This project is designed to search a league by the name of a professional soccer player and then return information,
statistics and standings.

## Reason for setting up the project
The purpose of this app is to eliminate the user from having to click through muliple layers and links to be able to get information and
statistics on a professional soccer player from the previous season of play. During our research on soccer players, we found there is no way to just pull up a players stats without going through mulitple steps. We also found information and many additional statistics about the player that were not readily available. 

## Useage
To use this app, one must click on a league name from the drop-down box.  Then the user must type in the name of a specific player name and 
click enter. The following information will be returned: Average Rating, Goals, xG, Assists, Pass Percentage, Successful Dribbles, Tackles, 
Inteceptions and Clearance.

## Direction of Future Development
To develop this app we used a database of only a small portion of professional soccer leagues. In order for this app to stand out and be
superior, we would like to be able to add the names of all the professional soccer leagues and their players. This will then provide the
user with a complete, concise resource to get any and all information, statistics and standings in one location.
